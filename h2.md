### PortSwigger: Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation

This PortSwigger article covers privilege escalataion, vulnerability types and the methods of preventing such vulrenabilities.
Some key points from the article:

#### Access control
- Authentication for user confirmation
- Session management id's HTTP requests to assess user
- Access contol decides if user has sufficient rights for action
#### Vertical access controls
- Vertical access controls categorize user types and assign function-specific rights i.e admin, user.
#### Horizontal access controls
- Horizontal access controls are used to restrict the information a user gets from provider.
#### Context-dependent access controls
- Context-depended access controls uses both Horizontal- and Vertical access controls to limit both function- and resource rights.
