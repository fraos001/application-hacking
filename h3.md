## a) 

I downloaded the ezbin-challenges.zip and unzipped it. Then I ran the program to see what it does. First I hypothesized, that I could inject code into the password field inside the program to fetch the password and flag strings.
But I couldn't find anything to back it up. While trying to find anything for my idea. I stumbled accross a wiki page for the strings command on bash.
After figuring out how to use it using `strings -help`, then I used the `strings passtr` command to see the human-readable part of the executable's bin files.

Here you can see, that the binary files show the password! Not gooood!

## b)

I tried to approach the problem with finding a way to hide the strings in the bin-files!

In this task.. I failed miserably! I tried to find any documentation on this problem but unfortunately couldn't find anything.
In the end I relied on Gemini Cli for help. Gemini suggested the `EXPORT` command. This makes it so I can assign and export a value into a new environment!
Like this:

I recompiled the passtr executable and ran the `strings passtr` again, which did infact hide the password and flag inside the binary files, but crashed the program when I tried running it!

Not a good fix. Doesn't work and needs the user to `EXPORT` the password and flag
