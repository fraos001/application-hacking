## a) 

I downloaded the ezbin-challenges.zip and unzipped it. Then I ran the program to see what it does. First I hypothesized, that I could inject code into the password field inside the program to fetch the password and flag strings.
But I couldn't find anything to back it up. While trying to find anything for my idea. I stumbled accross a wiki page for the strings command on bash.
After figuring out how to use it using `strings -help`, then I used the `strings passtr` command to see the human-readable part of the executable's bin files.

Here you can see, that the binary files show the password! Not gooood!

## b)

I tried to approach the problem with finding a way to hide the strings in the bin-files!

In this task.. I failed miserably! I tried to find any documentation on this problem but unfortunately couldn't find anything.
In the end I relied on Gemini Cli for help. Gemini suggested the `EXPORT` command. This makes it so I can assign and export a value into a new environment!
Like this:

I recompiled the passtr executable and ran the `strings passtr` again, which did infact hide the password and flag inside the binary files, but crashed the program when I tried running it!

Not a good fix. Doesn't work and needs the user to `EXPORT` the password and flag.

## c)

Now, I tried the `strings packd` command to see the packd binary files! This printed out binary files that looked different from the passtr binary files!

At first I thought it might be using a different encoding system, so I tried different variations of the strings command. Then I took a closer look at the binary-files and saw that
It started with UPX!! and ended with UPX!!

I searched for UPX on the internet and found UPX on github! From their page 

"Welcome to UPX !

UPX is a free, secure, portable, extendable, high-performance
executable packer for several executable formats."

Now I Installed UPX using `sudo dnf install upx`! Then I ran `upx -h` and found the `upx -d [filename]` command!

Now, after I ran `upx -d packd' in the /packd directory. This is what came out of `strings packd`!

Wow! Password = piilos-AnAnAs and Flag = Tero-0e3bed0a89d8851da933c64fefad4ff2!!!!

COOl!
